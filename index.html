                         <p class="text-white-50 ">The project was inspired by my love for contemporary dance. Contemporary dance is an interpretative dance style that values originality and incorporates skills from diverse genres such as ballroom dancing, freestyle, street dance, and lyrical dance. The laws that govern established choreography aren't applicable to this sort of performance, which emphasises floor work over leg work and pointe. Rather, it emphasises creativity and variety, as well as freedom of action and smoothness, allowing performers to explore the mind-body connection and, ultimately, eliciting emotional reactions. Contemporary dance is sometimes thought of as a sort of narrative, with performers portraying personas, replaying occurrences, or conveying life anecdotes. Its routines may also convey complex concepts like ethical standards, self-acceptance, and contemporary cultural challenges. Performers frequently appear barefoot, and their attire usually matches the theme or attitude of the musical accompaniment. This kind of dancing can be performed to a range of different genres, spoken word poetry and melodies, or quietness.

                            The character models were acquired from Mixamo which is an animation software system for cinema and computer games that can generate 3D figures. Mixamo offers a large collection of high-quality 3D models as well as numerous individual motions. Mixamo also guarantees that models are fully prepared by implementing a skeletal structure automatically. The models that were used are the following:
<br>1. Remy. <br>
2. Erika Archer. <br>


The motion data for the contemporary dances was picked from Mixamo. The following dances were used:

1. Thriller part three

                                The music that was used in the video is Michael Jackson’s “Thriller”. When the Thriller album was first released in the UK in 1982, it peaked at number one on the albums chart. ‘Thriller’ was released as a single the following year and landed at number 10 on the official UK singles chart in 1983. ‘Thriller’ had global success and landed at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US. It also reached number one in 1984 in Spain, France and Belgium. The song is a performance masterpiece and my appreciation for the artist informed my choice of music and choreography.

                                Lighting
                                The typical form of professional lighting in video production and still photography is three-point lighting. It entails the use of three light sources at three different locations. It is possible to change how light and shadow fall on a topic by adjusting the size, distance, intensity, and location of these ambient lights, as well as their downward angle.

                                    Challenges faced in designing the virtual scene
                                     </h6>
                                     <p >Aside from the unique concerns that digital world design brings, I anticipated to have some difficulties in transferring some of the difficulties present in 3D surroundings in the physical world to the computer domain. The following are some of the issues that arise from the design of the setting and entities:

                                       <br>1. Time and computing resources.
                                        <br> 2. Scene lighting.
                                         <br> 3. Global illumination flickering during the scene renders.
                                        <br> 4. Texturing models
                                        </p>

                               
                                <h4>Time and computing resources</h4>   
                                 <p></p>Large corporations have dedicated staff, state-of-the-art equipment, and pricey programs that can produce amazing images, and simulations on demand. Individual content creators, small businesses, hobbyists, and learners, on the other hand, may not be able to afford it. 3d computer graphics systems frequently only provide costly yearly fees, implying a big initial investment. Not to mention, newer versions are released each and every year, which may necessitate paid updates or a reinvestment. 
                                    With complex settings, unnecessary customizations, a clumsy interface design, and limiting materials, mastering this software will require time, commitment, and a great deal of talent. The more detailed your model is, the more difficult it is to render it. There's a high likelihood the program may crash completely. When engaging in demanding assignments, this can be incredibly exhausting.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Scene lighting</h4>   
                                <p >
                                    The way a main point of light is bounced or diverted off of several surfaces, such as the ceilings or surrounding surfaces, is called light bouncing. This reduces the harshness of the actual source illumination, resulting in a smooth, evenly spread cast. In the real world, the sun, and other limitless sources of light refract rays in different directions off every object, giving our surroundings a theatrical appearance.
                                    To simulate this appearance in a 3-dimensional render, render engines use indirect lighting or global illumination. Nearby items that are already bouncing light partially illuminate shadows. The softer the dispersion, the brighter the light source. Increased light bounces, on the other hand, equals longer render times. While omitting light rebounds results in drab, bland visuals, having far too many causes unpleasant glares. Figuring out the optimal number of bounces that are needed to properly illuminate a scene is difficult when the project has strict time and resource constraints.
                                  
                                </p>
                                <h4 > Global illumination flickering during the scene renders.
                                </h4>   
                                <p >
                                    When global illumination (GI) is used to light a virtual scene, the amount of assets illuminated in the scene increases. While this adds excitement to your graphic, it also introduces concerns like colour bleeding and flickering. We must ensure that the colour quality of light is not degraded while using bounce causes in an environment. A slight blue-tinged light is projected by bouncing light off a blue wall. This is known as colour bleeding, and it must be addressed. When the lighting rearranges in a video, each frame is calculated separately. 
As a result, a phenomenon known as flickering develops, in which the lights and shadows shift with each frame. Flickering was solved through the use of fewer assets and light sources with fewer bounces being calculated during rendering

                                </p>
                                <h4 >Texturing models
                                </h4>   
                                <p >
                                    Objects that are different to touch abound in real life. This palpable part of the physical world must be conveyed into 3d modelling at any costs. This is accomplished through the use of high-definition materials and textures. The overall outcome is influenced by texture quality, and a photorealistic rendering is unattainable without it. Again, higher texture resolution translates into longer render times. When texture quality is neglected, the scene appears plastic and lifeless. Finding the correct balance between texture quality and the load this has on the render engine was a challenge that took a long time to solve.
